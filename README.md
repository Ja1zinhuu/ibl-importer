# IBL-Importer

IBL Importer is a tool I'm developing on my free time and is compatible with Maya (2023+) and Houdini (19.0+). 
The tool has been developed out of necessity as I have hundreds of different HDRIs and Light Maps that I use for my CG Renders and manually going through files, testing in the scene, and redoing the process until I found one is extremely time consuming when you have that many files to go through.
IBL Importer has also been proven extremely useful in Production Environment, by being used by artists at The Flying Colour Company.
